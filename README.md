# MPW_MPD_Image-Prediction
Implementing convolutional neural network to predict the MPW and MPD based on PBF melt pool images.

The model was developed and trained using Pytorch open source framework. While the uploaded code is ran in Google's Colaboratory to utilize its GPU, I additionally uploaded the data that the model was trained on.
The data consists of 1) melt pool images during a PBF process in a COMSOL simulation and 2) exact melt pool width and depth values of the images computed algorithmically by LiveLink for MATLAB.
